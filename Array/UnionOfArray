Algorithm / Intuition
Solution 1: Using Map
Our aim is to find the common elements in arr1 and arr2, and the distinct elements of arr1,arr2. Use a Single map to find the frequencies of elements in arr1 and arr2.

As we are using only a single map the common element in arr1 and arr2 are treated as a single element for finding frequency, so there would be no duplicates.

Why not unordered_map?
In unordered_map the keys are stored in random order, while in the map the keys are stored in sorted order (ascending order by default). As we require elements of the union to be in ascending order, using a map is preferable.

We can also use unordered_map, but after finding the union of arr1 and arr2, we need to sort the union vector to get the elements of the union in sorted order.
